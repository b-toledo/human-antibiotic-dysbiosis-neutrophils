# human-antibiotic-dysbiosis-neutrophils
Code and analysis workflows for the manuscript on antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis and neutrophil response in humans.

<br>

## Overview

This repository contains the computational workflows used to process and analyze sequencing datasets generated in the study:

### “Short-term antibiotic treatment alters human blood neutrophil activation and gene regulation through microbiota disruption.”

The project investigates how acute perturbation of the gut microbiota influences human neutrophil biology by integrating microbiome, transcriptomic, and chromatin accessibility profiling.

<br>

## Scope of this repository

This repository contains only the computational pipelines related to sequencing data processing and downstream analyses, including:

- 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize stool microbiota composition

- RNA-seq to profile transcriptional changes in circulating neutrophils

- ATAC-seq to assess chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape remodeling in circulating neutrophils

Other experimental components of the study are not included in this repository.

All analyses are organized by data type and implemented using reproducible computational workflows.

## Experimental Design

Healthy male adult volunteers were treated with a short course of broad-spectrum antibiotics to induce transient microbiota disruption.

Samples collected:

| Sample type |	Timepoints | Analysis
| ----------- | -----------| ---------
| Stool | Pre / Post antibiotics |	16S rRNA microbiota profiling
| Peripheral blood neutrophils |	Pre / Post antibiotics (+/- LPS) |	RNA-seq
| Peripheral  blood neutrophils |	Pre / Post antibiotics |	ATAC-seq
