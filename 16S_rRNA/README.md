## 16S rRNA analysis

This folder contains the microbiota analysis workflow.

## Overview

This directory contains the analysis workflow used to characterize gut microbiota changes following short-term antibiotic treatment in healthy adults.

The analysis aimed to:
- quantify antibiotic-induced microbiota disruption
- identify taxonomic shifts associated with dysbiosis
- evaluate changes in microbial diversity
- predict functional profiles

Paired stool samples were collected before and after antibiotic exposure and analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V3-V4).

## Workflow Overview

The analysis consists of two major stages:

### 1. Raw sequence processing

Amplicon reads were processed using nf-core/ampliseq.

Steps include:
- Quality control
- Denoising and ASV inference (DADA2)
- Chimera removal
- Taxonomic classification (SILVA reference database (v138))
- Filtering of non-bacterial taxa
- Generation of feature tables and taxonomy assignments
- Functional prediction using PICRUSt

The pipeline was executed using Nextflow with Docker containers.

See ```run_nextflow.sh``` for execution command and ```params.yaml``` for pipeline parameters. 

### Input Files

#### Raw sequencing reads

Paired-end FASTQ files:
- *_R1.fq.gz
- *_R2.fq.gz

#### Metadata

Sample metadata are provided in ```metadata/metadata.tsv```

This file includes:
- sample ID
- condition (control: pre antibiotic/ treated: post antibiotic)
- subject ID

### 2. Downstream analysis

Downstream statistical analyses and visualization were performed in R.

Main steps include:
- Import ASV tables and taxonomy
- Construction of phyloseq objects
- Alpha diversity analysis
- Beta diversity analysis
- Taxonomic composition visualization
- Differential abundance testing
- Functional prediction

The full analysis workflow is available in ```scripts/*``` and ```notebooks/16S_Human-Dysbiosis-Analysis.Rmd```

## Data availability

Raw sequencing data are available in NCBI BioProject: PRJNA1402306
